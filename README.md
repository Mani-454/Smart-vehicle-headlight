# Smart-vehicle-headlight
An adaptive headlight control system using Arduino and LDR sensors to adjust headlight intensity based on ambient lighting. The system improves night driving safety by dynamically modifying brightness to prevent glare for oncoming vehicles while ensuring optimal visibility for the driver.

Smart Vehicle Headlight Auto Switching and Intensity Control:-

The Smart Vehicle Headlight Auto Switching and Intensity Control project leverages Arduino and LDR sensors to dynamically adjust vehicle headlight intensity based on ambient lighting conditions. This system aims to enhance road safety by preventing glare for oncoming drivers while ensuring optimal visibility for the vehicle operator during night-time driving. The implementation involves real-time data processing from the LDR sensor and pulse-width modulation (PWM) control for headlight brightness adjustment. This project offers a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution, bridging the gap between conventional manual headlight systems and advanced adaptive lighting technologies in modern vehicles.
